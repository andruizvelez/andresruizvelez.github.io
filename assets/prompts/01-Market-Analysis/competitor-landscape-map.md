<!--
## Description: Maps competitors on key dimensions, helping visualize the competitive landscape and identify gaps or differentiation opportunities.
## Usage Note: Use when comparing competitors or crafting positioning. Know your main competitors and consider two critical axes (e.g., price vs quality). The prompt will assist in defining axes and placing competitors.
## Instructions: The AI will ask for the important differentiating factors in your market to define the axes. Then it will go through your competitor list, prompting for characteristics to position them. Finally, it will output a summary of each competitor’s position and highlight any strategic insights (gaps or clusters).
## Attribution: Inspired by positioning maps and competitive quadrant charts (e.g., Gartner Magic Quadrant style analysis).

## Competitor Landscape Map

**Positioning Axes:**  
- X-Axis: [First key dimension, e.g., Price (Low ←→ High) or Ease of Use (Simple ←→ Complex)].  
- Y-Axis: [Second key dimension, e.g., Feature Richness (Few ←→ Many) or Target Market (SMB ←→ Enterprise)].

**Competitor Positions:**
- **Competitor A:** [High-level summary of where Competitor A sits on these axes, e.g., "High price, very feature-rich (Enterprise-focused)"].  
- **Competitor B:** [Summary for B, e.g., "Low cost, simple feature set (Entry-level for small businesses)"].  
- **Competitor C:** [Summary for C, e.g., "Moderately priced, extensive features but somewhat complex"].  
- **Competitor D:** [Summary for D, etc.].

**Analysis:**  
- [Mention any clusters or gaps: e.g., "Most competitors cluster in high-price enterprise segment, leaving a gap for a low-cost, high-feature solution"].  
- [Opportunities/Threats: e.g., "No competitor offers high simplicity with high feature richness – an opportunity for us to differentiate"].
