## Description: Analyzes the competitive environment using Porter’s Five Forces (threat of new entrants, threat of substitutes, bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, and industry rivalry).
## Usage Note: Use to evaluate market dynamics and profitability in a given industry. Provide context on your industry and any known players; the prompt will help assess each force.
## Instructions: The AI will go through each of the five forces, asking for insights (or using general knowledge) about your market. It will output each force with key factors and an indication of how strong that force is, helping inform strategy.

## Porter’s Five Forces Analysis

**1. Threat of New Entrants:**  
- [Factors making it easy or hard for new competitors to enter: e.g., capital requirements, regulatory barriers, brand loyalty].  
- [Is the threat High/Medium/Low? Explain briefly, e.g., "Medium – moderate startup costs but strong brand loyalty among existing players"].

**2. Threat of Substitutes:**  
- [Factors about alternative solutions that fulfill the same need: availability, price/performance of substitutes].  
- [Threat High/Medium/Low? e.g., "High – users can easily use free spreadsheets instead of our paid tool"].

**3. Bargaining Power of Buyers:**  
- [Factors that give customers leverage: e.g., are there many alternatives? low switching costs? buyers large/concentrated?].  
- [Power High/Medium/Low? e.g., "Low – customers are fragmented and no single client dictates terms, switching costs are moderate"].

**4. Bargaining Power of Suppliers:**  
- [Factors about your input providers: e.g., few suppliers or unique resources? high switching cost for you?].  
- [Power High/Medium/Low? e.g., "Medium – our software relies on one key API provider; moderate leverage for them"].

**5. Rivalry Among Competitors:**  
- [Factors driving competitive intensity: number of competitors, market growth, product differentiation, exit barriers].  
- [Rivalry High/Medium/Low? e.g., "High – many competitors with similar offerings, and price wars are common in a stagnant market"].
