<!--
## Description: Provides a structured TAM/SAM/SOM analysis to estimate market size and the portion your product can capture.
## Usage Note: Use for business planning or investor pitches. Have some data or assumptions about your market population and pricing. The prompt will guide you through calculating Total Addressable Market, Serviceable Market, and your share.
## Instructions: The AI will prompt for broad market numbers (TAM), then narrowing criteria for your segment (SAM), and finally your realistic target share (SOM). It will help with simple calculations and clarity on assumptions. The output will detail TAM, SAM, SOM with how each was derived.
## Attribution: Standard market sizing approach (TAM/SAM/SOM) used in product management and venture planning.

## Market Sizing Analysis

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**  
- [Define the broadest potential market: e.g., number of people or total revenue for everyone who might need your product globally].  
- TAM Calculation: [Show how TAM is calculated, e.g., X million potential users * $Y annual revenue per user = $Z billion].

**Serviceable Available Market (SAM):**  
- [Define the portion of TAM you can realistically reach (e.g., specific region or customer segment)].  
- SAM Calculation: [Show calculation or assumptions, e.g., "20% of TAM are in our target region = $Z1 billion"].

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):**  
- [Define the portion of SAM you expect to capture (your target market share in the next couple years)].  
- SOM Calculation: [Calculate with assumptions, e.g., "Assuming we capture 10% of SAM = $Z2 million/year"].

**Key Assumptions & Sources:**  
- [List important assumptions (growth rates, adoption rates, pricing) used in the above estimates].  
- [Cite data sources or reasoning for numbers if available, e.g., "Source: Industry report 2025 for total market size"].
