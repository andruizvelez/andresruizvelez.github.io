<!--
## Description: Generates a structured guide for customer interviews, with questions designed to test your hypotheses without leading the witness.
## Usage Note: Use when preparing user interviews. Come with a clear idea of what you want to learn (hypotheses) and who you're interviewing. The prompt will help formulate open-ended questions.
## Instructions: The AI will ask about your interview goals and hypotheses, then produce sections of an interview guide (intro, background, core questions, closing). It ensures questions are unbiased and cover all key topics. Provide your hypotheses and any specific areas of interest.
## Attribution: Draws on best practices from user research interviewing (e.g., "The Mom Test" principles for non-leading questions).
