<!--
## Description: Frames a user problem clearly by combining Jobs-to-be-Done with pains and gains, ensuring the team focuses on a well-defined problem.
## Usage Note: Use at the start of product discovery to articulate who the user is, what job they're trying to do, and their pains/gains. Have basic user info and initial research ready.
## Instructions: The AI will prompt you through identifying the target user, their key jobs, pains, and desired gains. It will then formulate a structured problem statement. Answer questions specifically; the AI will combine them into the canvas format.
## Attribution: Inspired by the Value Proposition Canvas (jobs, pains, gains) and Jobs-to-be-Done theory (Christensen & Osterwalder frameworks).

## Problem Discovery Canvas

### 1. Target User & Context
- **User**: [Describe the target user or customer segment experiencing the problem].
- **Context**: [Describe the situation or task where the user encounters the problem].

### 2. Customer Jobs-to-be-Done
<!-- Break down the job into functional, social, emotional aspects -->
- **Functional Goal**: [What is the core task or goal the user is trying to accomplish?].
- **Social/Emotional Goal**: [How does the user want to feel or be perceived while doing this?].

### 3. Pains (Challenges & Frustrations)
- [List key pain points, obstacles, or negative outcomes the user faces in this context].

### 4. Gains (Desired Outcomes)
- [List key positive outcomes, benefits, or "gains" the user would like to achieve].

### 5. Problem Statement (Summary)
- [Combine the insights above into a clear problem statement, e.g.: "When [User] tries to [Job], they experience [Pain], which makes them feel [Emotional impact]. They need a way to [Functional goal] that achieves [Gains]."].
