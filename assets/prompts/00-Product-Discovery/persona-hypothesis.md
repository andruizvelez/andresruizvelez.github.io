<!--
## Description: Quickly drafts a proto-persona (hypothetical persona) including key assumptions about a user’s characteristics, needs, and behaviors that can be validated later.
## Usage Note: Use when detailed user research is lacking but you need to articulate who you think your user is. Provide any known user attributes or behaviors, and the prompt will fill gaps with assumptions to test.
## Instructions: The AI will ask for basic context (product and audience) and then propose a persona profile: name, summary, goals, pain points, etc. It will clearly label assumptions that should be validated. Be honest about what is known vs guessed so the persona captures uncertainties.
## Attribution: Informed by Lean UX and design thinking practices for proto-personas (Jeff Gothelf) and traditional persona frameworks (Alan Cooper).

## Persona Hypothesis

**Persona Name:** [Give the persona a descriptive name (e.g., "Proactive Pete" or "Organized Olivia")].

**Profile Summary:** [Summarize who this persona is (role, demographic, context) and their situation in one or two sentences].

**Goals and Motivations:**
- [Describe what this persona wants to achieve and why it’s important to them].

**Pain Points and Challenges:**
- [List the key frustrations, problems, or unmet needs this persona experiences].

**Behaviors:**
- [List notable behaviors or habits relevant to your product (e.g., how they currently solve the problem, technology use patterns)].

**Assumptions to Validate:**
- [Highlight key assumptions about this persona that need validation. For example: "Assuming they check analytics daily" or "Assuming price sensitivity is a major concern"].
