<!--
## Description: Breaks down what customers truly seek to accomplish by detailing functional, social, and emotional jobs-to-be-done, along with associated pains and gains.
## Usage Note: Use to gain a deep understanding of customer goals and struggles. Have a particular user segment or scenario in mind. The prompt will systematically examine jobs and the pains/gains around them.
## Instructions: The AI will guide you to identify a customer's functional, social, and emotional jobs first. Then it will prompt for pains (obstacles, costs, problems) and gains (benefits, improvements) related to those jobs. It will output a structured analysis of jobs, pains, and gains for clarity.
## Attribution: Based on Jobs-to-be-Done theory (Anthony Ulwick, Clayton Christensen) and the Value Proposition Canvas approach to pains/gains.
