<!--
## Description: Helps map opportunities, solutions, and assumptions in a visual tree format, allowing teams to explore multiple paths to a desired outcome.
## Usage Note: Use when exploring product discovery options after defining an outcome metric. Ensure you know your product outcome or goal; the prompt will guide identifying customer opportunities and matching solutions.
## Instructions: The AI will ask for your desired outcome, then help brainstorm opportunities (customer needs/problems) and possible solutions for each. It will prompt you to consider assumptions under each solution. Finally, it will present an opportunity-solution tree outline.

## Opportunity Solution Tree

**Desired Outcome:** [Define the specific product/business outcome you want to achieve (e.g., increase conversion by X%)].

### Opportunity 1: [Describe a user need or problem to solve related to the outcome]
- **Solution Idea 1:** [One potential solution to address Opportunity 1].
  - *Assumption:* [Key assumption that must be true for Solution 1 to succeed].
- **Solution Idea 2:** [Another solution for Opportunity 1].
  - *Assumption:* [Key assumption for Solution 2].

### Opportunity 2: [Another major user need or problem]
- **Solution Idea 1:** [Solution idea to address Opportunity 2].
  - *Assumption:* [Key assumption for this solution].
- **Solution Idea 2:** [Another solution for Opportunity 2].
  - *Assumption:* [Key assumption for this solution].
