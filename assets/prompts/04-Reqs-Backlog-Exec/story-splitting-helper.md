<!--
## Description: Helps break down a large user story or epic into smaller, value-adding stories that can be delivered incrementally.
## Usage Note: Use when a story is too big to complete in one iteration. Bring a description of the epic and perhaps ideas on how it could be sliced. The prompt will suggest ways to split by functionality, user goal, or scenario.
## Instructions: The AI will ask for the epic or big story details. Then it will propose multiple smaller stories or slices, explaining what each includes/excludes. You can refine or ask for different slicing approaches (e.g., by user segment or by happy/edge path). The output provides a list of smaller stories ready for grooming.
## Attribution: Based on agile story-splitting techniques (informed by Mike Cohnâ€™s user stories and user story mapping from Jeff Patton).

## Story Splitting Helper

**Epic Description:**  
"[Write a brief description of the large epic or feature that needs splitting]"

**Proposed Smaller Stories:**

1. **Story Slice 1:** [Description of the first smaller story focusing on a core subset of functionality].  
   - *Includes:* [What functionality or scenario this slice covers].  
   - *Excludes:* [What is deliberately left out or saved for later].

2. **Story Slice 2:** [Description of the second smaller story].  
   - *Includes:* [Scope of this slice].  
   - *Excludes:* [What it does not include].

3. **Story Slice 3:** [Description of the third slice].  
   - *Includes:* [Scope].  
   - *Excludes:* [Exclusions].

*(If needed, continue with more slices.)*

**Notes:**  
- [Point out if slices are end-to-end vertical slices delivering user value independently].  
- [Mention any dependency or sequence (e.g., Story 2 might logically come after Story 1)].  
- [Encourage validation of each slice with stakeholders].
