<!--
## Description: Translates a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) into a high-level Product Requirements Document (PRD) that is more accessible to stakeholders.
## Usage Note: Use when you have a technical spec and need to create a product-friendly overview. The prompt will guide extracting key points (goals, scope, requirements) and rewriting them in PRD format. Have the SRS content or highlights ready.
## Instructions: The AI will likely ask for sections or content from the SRS (like objectives, system requirements, constraints). It will then structure a PRD with sections such as Background, Scope, User Stories, Functional Requirements, etc. The output can be used as a draft PRD which you can refine further with business context.
## Attribution: Informed by common structures in PRDs (from product management best practices) and experience in simplifying technical documentation.

## Reverse-Engineered PRD

**1. Background & Objectives:**  
- [Summarize the project background: Why are we building this product/feature? What goals does it aim to achieve? Derived from SRS introduction].
- [Include context or problem statement that the product addresses].

**2. Scope (In/Out):**  
- In Scope: [List the functionalities and areas that the product/release will cover (from SRS scope)].  
- Out of Scope: [Clarify anything explicitly not included or deferred].

**3. Key User Stories / Use Cases:**  
- [User Story 1: Brief user-centric description of a core requirement].  
- [User Story 2: Another key scenario or requirement].  
*(Capture the main use cases the SRS addresses in user-friendly terms.)*

**4. Functional Requirements:**  
- [Requirement Group 1]: [Summarize a set of related requirements].  
  - [Detail 1 from SRS in simpler wording].  
  - [Detail 2 â€¦].  
- [Requirement Group 2]: [Summary].  
  - [Requirement details...]

**5. Non-Functional Requirements:**  
- [Performance expectations, e.g., "System supports X concurrent users with <Y ms latency"].  
- [Security requirements, compliance needs].  
- [Any other constraints like compatibility, scalability from SRS].

**6. Assumptions & Dependencies:**  
- [List any assumptions (technical or business) that were noted in SRS or that product is making].  
- [List external dependencies, e.g., third-party services, components from other teams].

**7. Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [Highlight what will be considered a successful implementation for each major feature, possibly referencing user story acceptance criteria].

**8. Open Questions:**  
- [Any ambiguities or unresolved points from the SRS to be clarified with stakeholders].

*(This PRD draft should be reviewed and refined with input from both technical and business stakeholders to ensure it captures the essence of the SRS in a clear, prioritized way.)*
