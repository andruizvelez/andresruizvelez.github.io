<!--
## Description: Provides a checklist to ensure your acceptance criteria are well-written and comprehensive, improving the quality of user stories and their testability.
## Usage Note: Use when reviewing or writing acceptance criteria for a story. The prompt will remind you of the key qualities and cases to cover. No specific input is needed aside from the draft criteria themselves.
## Instructions: The AI will present a checklist of questions or statements. Go through each item and verify your acceptance criteria meet them. If something is missing (e.g., no error case criteria), update your story’s acceptance criteria accordingly. The output is a reusable checklist you can apply to any user story.
## Attribution: Informed by agile QA practices and BDD guidelines that define what good acceptance criteria should include.

## Acceptance Criteria Quality Checklist

- [ ] **Clarity:** Are the criteria written in clear, unambiguous language? (Each criterion should be easy to understand with no vague terms.)
- [ ] **Testability:** Can each criterion be tested and objectively verified (pass/fail)? (Avoid subjective language like "easy to use".)
- [ ] **Coverage of Scenarios:** Do the criteria cover normal case, edge cases, and error conditions? (Consider how the feature should behave if something goes wrong.)
- [ ] **One Objective per Criterion:** Does each acceptance criterion address a single behavior or outcome? (Split into separate criteria if it covers multiple outcomes.)
- [ ] **Given/When/Then Format:** (Optional) If using BDD style, are the criteria in proper Given/When/Then format for consistency?
- [ ] **Business Value Alignment:** Do the criteria tie back to the user story’s intent? (Ensure fulfilling the criteria indeed delivers the user’s expected benefit.)
- [ ] **Consensus:** Have the team/stakeholders agreed that these criteria accurately reflect “done”? (This ensures no surprises in what’s being delivered.)

*Use this checklist to review each user story’s acceptance criteria and improve them before development begins.*
