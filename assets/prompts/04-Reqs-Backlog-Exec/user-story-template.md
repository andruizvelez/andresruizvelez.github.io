<!--
## Description: Guides you in writing clear user stories with proper format and acceptance criteria using Gherkin syntax, ensuring requirements are testable and user-focused.
## Usage Note: Use for writing or refining user stories in your backlog. The prompt will ask for the user role, goal, and reason (for the story), and details for acceptance criteria. Have the feature or requirement context ready.
## Instructions: The AI will walk through constructing the user story sentence ("As a..., I want..., so that...") and then help define acceptance criteria, often in Given/When/Then form. It ensures each criterion is specific and testable. Provide as much detail as possible for realistic criteria.
## Attribution: Follows the User Story format by Connextra and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) practices using Gherkin syntax for acceptance criteria.
