- **PR & Media:** [e.g., press release distribution, pitching to tech blogs or industry publications, launch event or webinar].  
- **Community & Influencers:** [e.g., reach out to influencers or communities in the space to beta test or endorse, engage on forums].  
- **Sales/Partnerships:** [e.g., if B2B, direct sales outreach to key clients, partnerships with complementary services].  
- **Internal Enablement:** [Train sales and support teams, prepare FAQ and demo scripts].

**Launch Timeline:**  
- **Pre-Launch (Phase 1):** [Dates] – [Build hype: teaser campaigns, beta release to select users, gather testimonials].  
- **Launch (Phase 2):** [Date] – [Main launch actions: press release goes live, product available to all, kickoff event, coordinated announcements].

- [Metric 2, etc., possibly including marketing metrics like site visits or CAC, as well as product metrics].

**Risks & Mitigations:**  
- [Risk: e.g., Low initial adoption] – Mitigation: [Plan, e.g., ramp up referral incentives or adjust messaging if traction is slow].  
- [Risk: e.g., Budget or resource constraints] – Mitigation: [Prioritize highest-ROI channels, leverage organic efforts].  
- [Risk: e.g., Competitor reaction or market event] – Mitigation: [Be prepared with differentiating PR, emphasize unique features].
