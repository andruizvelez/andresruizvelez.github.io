<!--
## Description: Compiles potential launch risks with their likelihood, impact, and mitigation plans, helping the team proactively manage issues that could derail a product launch.
## Usage Note: Use during launch planning. Think about things that might go wrong (technical issues, marketing delays, etc.). The prompt will help categorize these risks and formulate mitigation strategies.
## Instructions: The AI will prompt for different types of risks or directly ask for any concerns. It will then output a list of risks, each annotated with an assessment (likelihood, impact) and a mitigation plan. Be honest about worst-case scenarios; preparing for them will increase launch confidence.
## Attribution: Borrowed from risk management best practices in project management (risk registers commonly used in PMBOK and Agile release planning).

## Launch Risk Register

- **Risk:** [Description of Risk #1, e.g., "Server instability due to high traffic on launch day"].  
  - *Likelihood:* [High/Medium/Low] – [Brief justification if needed].  
  - *Impact:* [High/Medium/Low] – [What happens if this occurs, e.g., "Users have a bad experience, drop-off increases"].  
  - *Mitigation:* [Plan to reduce likelihood or impact, e.g., "Conduct load testing beforehand and have engineers on-call launch week"].

- **Risk:** [Risk #2, e.g., "Key feature delivery slips past launch date"].  
  - *Likelihood:* [H/M/L] – [Reason, e.g., "Feature is complex and still in QA"].  
  - *Impact:* [H/M/L] – [Consequence, e.g., "Launch without this feature diminishes value prop in marketing"].  
  - *Mitigation:* ["Define a reduced-scope version to ship if needed and update messaging accordingly"].

- **Risk:** [Risk #3, e.g., "Negative early user feedback or PR"].  
  - *Likelihood:* [H/M/L] – [e.g., "Medium – untested messaging might cause misunderstanding"].  
  - *Impact:* [H/M/L] – ["Could slow adoption if not addressed swiftly"].  
  - *Mitigation:* ["Prepare a FAQ and customer support plan; monitor social/media closely and respond within 24h to issues"].

- **Risk:** [Risk #4, etc.].  
  - *Likelihood:* [H/M/L] – [...].  
  - *Impact:* [H/M/L] – [...].  
  - *Mitigation:* [...].

*(Review and update this register frequently as launch approaches, ensuring each risk has an owner and a clear mitigation or contingency plan.)*
