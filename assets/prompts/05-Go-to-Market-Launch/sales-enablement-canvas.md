<!--
## Description: Prepares key information that sales teams need to sell the product effectively: who the customer is, their pain points, how the product helps, key benefits, common objections, and proof points.
## Usage Note: Use when launching a product or new feature so sales and customer-facing teams have a cheat sheet. Provide product value propositions, known customer pain points, and likely objections. The prompt will organize these into a concise enablement guide.
## Instructions: The AI will ask for details on target customers, pain points, product features, and any testimonials or data. It will produce sections covering the customer profile, value prop, feature highlights, objection handling, and available sales collateral. Share this with sales to ensure consistent and informed messaging.
## Attribution: Informed by sales enablement best practices and one-page playbooks that align sales with product messaging.
