<!--
## Description: Uses Amazon’s “Working Backwards” approach to produce a draft press release and FAQ for your product, clarifying the value proposition and anticipated questions before development is finalized.
## Usage Note: Use in early product definition or pre-launch. Provide your product’s key details (name, target user, problem solved, key features). The prompt will craft a press release announcement and a set of FAQs as if for launch day.
## Instructions: The AI will query you for product basics (who it’s for, what it does, why it’s different, launch timing). Then it will generate a press release in journalistic tone followed by common Q&A. Use this to refine your messaging and identify open questions. Aim for clear, customer-centric language in your answers.
## Attribution: Based on Amazon’s Press Release & FAQ (PR/FAQ) template for product definition, advocated by Jeff Bezos.
