<!--
## Description: Identifies key stakeholders for your project and maps their level of influence and interest, along with their primary concerns, to help you strategize stakeholder management.
## Usage Note: Use when starting a project or change initiative. List your stakeholders (by role or name) and what you know about their interests. The prompt will guide analyzing who needs close management versus periodic communication and how to address their concerns.
## Instructions: The AI will ask about each stakeholder’s influence (power over the project) and interest (how much they care about the outcome). For each, it will also inquire about their main expectations or fears. The output will categorize stakeholders and suggest how to engage each (manage closely, keep satisfied, keep informed, monitor). Use this map to plan communications and preempt resistance.
## Attribution: Uses stakeholder analysis models (like the Power/Interest grid by Mendelow) combined with risk mitigation strategies from change management.

## Stakeholder Risk Mapping

- **Stakeholder A – [Role/Title]:**  
  - *Influence:* High (has significant decision-making power or veto authority over the project)  
  - *Interest:* High (deeply invested in the project’s outcome)  
  - *Key Concerns:* [Their main interests or worries, e.g., "Will it deliver ROI?" or "Disruption to current operations"].  
  - *Management Strategy:* Manage Closely – [Plan: e.g., "Schedule weekly check-ins and involve in key decisions. Provide data to address ROI concerns."].

- **Stakeholder B – [Role]:**  
  - *Influence:* High  
  - *Interest:* Low (cares less about details, mostly concerned if it impacts their domain)  
  - *Key Concerns:* [e.g., "Ensure it doesn’t negatively affect my department's KPIs"].  
  - *Management Strategy:* Keep Satisfied – [Plan: "Provide monthly high-level updates, highlight how project supports their department’s goals. Address any hints of dissatisfaction quickly."].

- **Stakeholder C – [Role]:**  
  - *Influence:* Low  
  - *Interest:* High  
  - *Key Concerns:* [e.g., "Wants the project to succeed; may be an end-user or champion, concerned with usability or day-to-day impact"].  
  - *Management Strategy:* Keep Informed – [Plan: "Send regular updates/newsletters. Invite feedback and ideas since they’re enthusiastic. Engage them as a project advocate."].

- **Stakeholder D – [Role]:**  
  - *Influence:* Low  
  - *Interest:* Low  
  - *Key Concerns:* [e.g., "Not directly affected; minimal awareness or interest"].  
  - *Management Strategy:* Monitor – [Plan: "Minimal communication needed. Keep on radar for any change in influence or interest"]. 

**Summary:**  
- [Summarize if any group of stakeholders needs special attention, e.g., "Technical team leads (high interest, high influence) are critical champions, we’ll involve them in demos"].  
- [Note any upcoming actions, e.g., "After initial launch, re-evaluate stakeholder map as interest/influence may shift (e.g., execs might take greater interest once results come in)"].
