<!--
## Description: Extracts the key points from a detailed document or plan to create a concise executive summary suitable for high-level audiences.
## Usage Note: Use when you need to summarize a longer report or proposal. Provide the main sections (objective, results, issues, etc.) of your content. The prompt will condense each into a bullet or sentence, focusing on what executives care about.
## Instructions: The AI will prompt for the critical details: what is the purpose, what have we achieved or learned, any problems, and what do we need next. It will then output a short set of bullet points covering these. Use this to communicate effectively with time-strapped stakeholders.
## Attribution: Follows the BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) principle and best practices in executive communications.
