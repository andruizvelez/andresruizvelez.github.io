<!--
## Description: Helps you outline a pitch as a series of storyboard scenes, making it easier to visualize and communicate your product idea in a narrative flow.
## Usage Note: Use when preparing a pitch deck or video. Have your product’s problem, solution, and benefits in mind. The prompt will break the story into key scenes (problem, solution introduction, outcome) so you can later create slides or illustrations for each.
## Instructions: The AI will ask for the major points of your story – the protagonist (user) and their problem, how the product is introduced, and the happy ending. It will then present a sequence of scenes with guidance on visuals and captions. You can use these as a storyboard to design actual pitch materials.
## Attribution: Inspired by visual storytelling and pitch frameworks (commonly used in product storytelling and advertising to structure engaging narratives).
