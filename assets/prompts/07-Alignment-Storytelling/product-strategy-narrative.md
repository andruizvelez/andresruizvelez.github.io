<!--
## Description: Turns your product strategy into a compelling story that explains the “why” and “how” in a narrative format, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and remember.
## Usage Note: Use when you have defined a strategy (target market, product vision, strategic pillars) and need to communicate it broadly. Provide the core elements of your strategy; the prompt will weave them into a narrative arc.
## Instructions: The AI will inquire about the context (market or user pain), your vision for the future, and the strategic pillars or themes of your plan. It will then generate a narrative that starts with the current challenge, introduces your vision as the resolution, and outlines how strategic pillars lead to that vision. Use this story to align and inspire your team and stakeholders.
## Attribution: Utilizes storytelling techniques (as taught by leaders like Nancy Duarte and Marty Cagan) applied to product strategy communication.

## Product Strategy Narrative

**1. The Context (Setting the Stage):**  
[Begin with a brief depiction of the current landscape or problem scenario. For example: "In 2025, [target users] struggle with ..."]  
[Highlight why the status quo is not ideal – the pain points or market shifts that demand a new approach].

**2. The Vision (A Glimpse of a Better Future):**  
[Present your product vision as the answer to the above challenge. E.g., "We envision a world where ... (describe the improved future state for your users)"].  
[Make it aspirational yet concrete enough to picture outcomes].

**3. Strategic Pillars (How We'll Get There):**  
[Introduce the 2-3 key strategic themes or pillars underpinning your strategy.]  
- **Pillar 1:** [Name of pillar] – [Explain how this theme contributes to achieving the vision. For instance, a focus on user experience, or leveraging AI, etc., and why it matters].  
- **Pillar 2:** [Name] – [Explanation of this pillar].  
- **Pillar 3:** [Name, if applicable] – [Explanation].

**4. The Journey (Linking Pillars to Vision):**  
[Tie it all together in a narrative flow: "By executing on these pillars, we will overcome the current challenges. For example, by focusing on Pillar 1, we'll solve ...; through Pillar 2, we'll ..."]  
[Describe how each strategic pillar addresses parts of the context problem and moves the product toward the vision. Possibly include a short illustrative story or scenario for each].

**5. The Outcome (Why It Matters):**  
[Conclude with the payoff: restate how the strategy will make a difference for customers and the company. E.g., "In the end, [Company/Product] will transform [industry or user experience] by ..., leading to [measurable benefit or market position]."]  
[Maybe include a call-to-action or rallying call: "This is our story, and every team member/stakeholder is a part of making it reality."].

*(Use this narrative as a guide in presentations or documents to ensure all stakeholders share a common understanding and excitement about the strategy.)*
