<!--
## Description: Explores reasons why users or customers are churning (leaving), by examining usage data, feedback, and market factors, and suggests strategies to improve retention.
## Usage Note: Use when you observe declining retention or want to proactively address churn. Provide any known churn data or customer feedback themes. The prompt will guide a thorough consideration of possible churn drivers and recommend retention improvements.
## Instructions: The AI will ask about churn patterns (who is churning, when) and possible causes you've noticed. It will then output likely causes grouped by category (product issues, fit, competition, etc.) along with supporting evidence if available. Finally, it will list actionable steps to reduce churn. This analysis can inform your retention strategy and win-back campaigns.
## Attribution: Draws on customer success and SaaS best practices for churn analysis (e.g., reasons categorization and churn mitigation strategies).

## Churn Analysis

**Churn Overview:**  
- [State your churn rate or number of users lost in a period, e.g., "Monthly churn is 5%, meaning X users cancel each month"].  
- [Identify if churn is increasing, steady, or seasonal].

**Churn Pattern Insights:**  
- **When:** [Describe when churn tends to happen, e.g., "Users often leave around month 2-3 of usage"].  
- **Who:** [Which segment has higher churn? e.g., "SMB customers churn more than enterprise", or "New users from campaign X had higher churn"].  
- **Feedback:** [Summarize any common reasons from exit surveys or feedback, e.g., "Many cite 'lack of needed features' or 'too expensive'"].

**Likely Causes of Churn:**  
- **Product Fit & Value:** [e.g., "Product may not be delivering expected value or has missing features causing users to leave"].  
- **Onboarding & Engagement:** [e.g., "Some users never fully set up or adopt key features (poor onboarding)"].  
- **Customer Support/Experience:** [e.g., "Slow support response or bugs might frustrate users away"].  
- **Competition:** [e.g., "Users might be switching to a competitor offering X"].  
- **Pricing/ROI:** [e.g., "Customers might feel the cost doesn’t justify the value after a while"].

**Additional Factors:**  
- [Any external factors: e.g., market downturn reducing budgets, changes in customer’s business needs].  
- [Internal changes: e.g., recent price increase or policy change correlating with churn spike].

**Recommendations to Reduce Churn:**  
1. **Improve Onboarding:** [Plan, e.g., "Implement guided tutorials or onboarding checklist to help users reach value faster"].  
2. **Engage Early & Often:** [e.g., "Set up automated emails or in-app tips in first 30 days to encourage feature usage"].  
3. **Address Common Pain Points:** [e.g., "Fast-track development of the most requested features or fixes mentioned in feedback"].  
4. **Review Pricing/Packaging:** [e.g., "Consider flexible plans or discounts for at-risk users; ensure pricing matches delivered value"].  
5. **Proactive Outreach:** [e.g., "Have customer success reach out to users showing drop in activity before they churn"].  
6. **Win-back Offers:** [e.g., "For those who churn, send a survey and offer a tailored incentive to return once issues are addressed"].

**Next Steps:**  
- [Pick the top 1-2 strategies and create a project for each, assign owners].  
- [Set up metrics to track improvement (e.g., measure churn rate after onboarding changes)].  
- [Continue gathering feedback from both current and recently churned users to refine understanding of churn drivers].
