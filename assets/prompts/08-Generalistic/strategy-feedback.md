# Structured Strategy Feedback

<!--
## Description:
This template helps product managers stress-test a product or go-to-market strategy by simulating multiple perspectives.  
It ensures a holistic evaluation across market fit, financial impact, execution feasibility, and differentiation.  
AI is instructed to progressively ask for missing inputs before providing analysis, preventing shallow feedback.

## Usage Note:
Use when you have a product, business, or GTM strategy draft.  
If critical context is missing (e.g., goals, target market, competitive positioning), the AI should pause and prompt you to provide it before continuing.

## Instructions:
1. Provide your strategy draft.  
2. The AI will ask clarifying questions to ensure sufficient context.  
3. Once context is complete, the AI will generate structured, role-based feedback and recommendations.

**Prompt:**  
"Based on the strategy draft I’ll share, please guide me through clarifying questions until you have enough context.  
Then provide structured strategy feedback using the template below.  
If the input is insufficient, stop and ask me for what’s missing first.  
Render the feedback as Markdown."
