# Prototype Stress Test & Hole-Finding

<!--
## Description:
This template helps product managers critically review prototypes by simulating multiple perspectives (UX, QA, PM, Engineering).  
It ensures identification of missing flows, edge cases, accessibility concerns, and technical feasibility risks.  
AI must progressively ask for missing context (personas, flows, states) before evaluation.

## Usage Note:
Use when you have Figma flows, wireframes, or detailed prototype descriptions.  
If only partial input is provided, the AI should ask clarifying questions before drafting feedback.

## Instructions:
1. Provide prototype details.  
2. AI will ask clarifying questions to fill in gaps (e.g., persona, intended use cases, error states).  
3. Once context is sufficient, AI generates a structured issue log and recommendations.

**Prompt:**  
"Let’s review this prototype together.  
First, ask me clarifying questions about the personas, flows, and states.  
Once context is complete, generate a structured prototype review using the template below.  
If important inputs are missing, pause and request them first.  
Render output in Markdown."
