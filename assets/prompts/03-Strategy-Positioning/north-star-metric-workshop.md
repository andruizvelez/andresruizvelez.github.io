<!--
## Description: Facilitates identifying or refining your product’s North Star Metric (the one metric that best captures the core value users get), through a guided brainstorming and evaluation process.
## Usage Note: Use when you need to choose a North Star Metric or validate that the right one is selected. Make sure you have clarity on your product’s value and some supporting data. The prompt will lead you from defining value to evaluating possible metrics.
## Instructions: The AI will start by asking about the product’s core value to users. Then it will help brainstorm candidate metrics and evaluate them against criteria (e.g., actionable, predictive of success). Finally, it will prompt you to select one metric and identify supporting inputs to drive it. The output is a structured record of this process for team alignment.
## Attribution: Inspired by the North Star Metric approach advocated by growth experts (e.g., Sean Ellis, Amplitude’s North Star framework).

## North Star Metric Workshop

**Core Value Definition:**  
- [Describe the main value your product delivers to users/customers in one sentence].

**Candidate Metrics Brainstorm:**  
- [Metric 1: A potential North Star Metric (e.g., weekly active teams)] – [Why it might represent core value].  
- [Metric 2: Another candidate metric] – [Rationale].  
- [Metric 3: Another candidate if any] – [Rationale].

**Evaluation of Candidates:**  
*(Use criteria like: does it reflect user value, is it measurable/actionable, does it correlate with business success?)*  
- *Metric 1:* [Brief evaluation notes – e.g., "Reflects engagement well, easy to measure, but might be lagging indicator"].  
- *Metric 2:* [Notes].  
- *Metric 3:* [Notes].

**Chosen North Star Metric:**  
- **Metric:** [Name the selected NSM].  
- **Reasoning:** [Why this metric was chosen over the others – how it best captures product value].

**Key Inputs/Drivers:**  
- [List 2-3 key sub-metrics or inputs that drive the North Star Metric. For example, if NSM is “weekly engaged teams,” inputs might be “invitations sent” or “projects created per team”].

**Next Steps:**  
- [Outline how the team will align around this NSM – e.g., set targets, dashboards, review cadence].  
- [Any experiments or initiatives planned to improve this metric].
