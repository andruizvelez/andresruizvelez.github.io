<!--
## Description: Aligns your product’s value to customer needs by matching customer jobs/pains/gains with product features (pain relievers & gain creators).
## Usage Note: Use to refine product-market fit. Gather what you know about customer jobs, pain points, and desired gains, as well as your product’s features. The prompt will help map each pain to a pain reliever and each gain to a gain creator.
## Instructions: The AI will prompt for lists of customer jobs, pains, and gains, then for your product’s features or capabilities. It will assist in linking them, ensuring each major pain has a corresponding solution and each sought gain is delivered. The output highlights where your value proposition is strong or if gaps exist.

## Value Proposition Canvas

**Customer Profile:**  
- **Jobs-to-be-Done:** [List the main tasks or goals the customer is trying to accomplish].  
- **Pains:** [List the problems, negative experiences, or risks the customer encounters while trying to do these jobs].  
- **Gains:** [List the positive outcomes and benefits the customer wants to achieve].

**Value Map:**  
- **Products & Services:** [List your product’s key features or components].  
- **Pain Relievers:** [For each pain above, describe how your product alleviates it.].  
- **Gain Creators:** [For each desired gain, describe how your product enables or enhances it.].

**Fit Summary:**  
- [Explain how well the pain relievers and gain creators align with the customer profile. Highlight areas of strong fit and any pain or gain not addressed].  
- [Identify gaps if any: e.g., "Customers want X but our product doesn’t yet provide Y"].
