<!--
## Description: Provides a canvas to capture and compare strategic bets – major initiatives or investments – by outlining their potential upside, risks, required investment, and strategic alignment.
## Usage Note: Use for strategic planning or product portfolio review. List the big initiatives you’re considering. The prompt will guide through documenting each bet’s benefits and risks so you can make informed decisions about where to focus.
## Instructions: The AI will ask for each bet or project, then for details: description, expected payoff, risks, resource needs, confidence, and alignment with strategy. After iterating through bets, it can help you compare or prioritize them based on these factors. The output is a canvas entry for each bet, useful for discussion with stakeholders.
## Attribution: Inspired by strategic planning and risk assessment techniques (e.g., RICE scoring, product opportunity evaluation frameworks, and Marty Cagan’s concept of betting on strategic objectives).
