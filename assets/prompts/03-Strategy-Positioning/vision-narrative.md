<!--
## Description: Co-creates a vivid product vision narrative using storytelling techniques, helping you communicate the future you’re aiming for in an engaging way.
## Usage Note: Use to articulate a long-term vision in story form. Have an idea of the future impact of your product; the prompt will help flesh it out with characters, conflict, and resolution so it resonates emotionally.
## Instructions: The AI will ask for the elements of your vision (the protagonist, the problem, the change your product brings). It will then produce a narrative structured like a story (context, challenge, transformation, outcome). Use this narrative to inspire stakeholders and team members.
## Attribution: Inspired by vision storytelling approaches (like Amazon’s future press release and narrative techniques in product leadership).

## Vision Narrative

*Introduction (Future Context):*  
[Set the scene in a future where your vision is realized. Introduce a main character (user or company) and describe the world or scenario they are in, highlighting how it’s different from today].

*The Challenge (Problem Today):*  
[Backtrack to explain the core problem or status quo that existed before the vision was achieved. What pain or need existed? Why was change necessary?].

*The Transformation (Solution Emerges):*  
[Narrate how your product/strategy comes into play. Describe the journey or key actions taken to address the challenge. Use storytelling – perhaps the main character discovers or implements your solution, overcoming obstacles].

*The Outcome (Vision Realized):*  
[Describe the new reality after your solution has been implemented and the vision accomplished. How are things better for the user or world? Provide tangible positive outcomes and an emotional payoff].

*Conclusion:*  
[Tie the story back to the present, if needed, emphasizing the vision as a guiding light. End with an inspiring statement or call-to-action that invites the reader to help make this vision a reality].
