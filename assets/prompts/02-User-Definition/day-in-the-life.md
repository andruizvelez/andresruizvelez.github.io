<!--
## Description: Simulates a typical day for your user to uncover context, pain points, and opportunities that may not be obvious in a standard workflow analysis.
## Usage Note: Use to build empathy and find latent needs. Provide a persona or user type and scenario. The prompt will walk through morning, afternoon, evening (or relevant periods) describing the user's activities and interactions.
## Instructions: The AI will ask about the user’s daily routine and context. It then narrates a day-in-the-life, weaving in moments where the user might use your product or face problems it could solve. The output helps you understand user context and identify opportunities that align with their routine.
## Attribution: Day-in-the-life storytelling technique from user-centered design and ethnographic research.

## Day-in-the-Life Scenario

**Morning:**  
- [Describe the user’s morning routine as it relates to your product domain. Include tasks they do, any frustrations or needs that arise early in the day].
- [Mention opportunities where a solution (your product) could help in the morning context].

**Afternoon:**  
- [Describe the user’s midday activities. Note how work or daytime responsibilities might involve pain points your product addresses].
- [Include any context-specific issues (e.g., multitasking, mobile use) and how a solution could fit in].

**Evening:**  
- [Describe end-of-day activities and wrap-up. Are there lingering challenges or preparation for the next day that relate to your product?].
- [Highlight how the user feels by evening (tired, accomplished?) and if there’s an opportunity for your product to provide value at this time].

**Key Observations:**  
- [Summarize important insights: e.g., times of day when the user is most frustrated or open to trying a solution].
- [Note any unmet needs or ideas discovered through this narrative that could guide product features or support].
