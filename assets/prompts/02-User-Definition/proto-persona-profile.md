<!--
## Description: Creates a light-weight persona profile (proto-persona) based on limited data and hypotheses, including background, goals, pain points, and behaviors.
## Usage Note: Use in early stages of product development to humanize your target user. Provide any known details about your intended user group; the prompt will generate a persona with assumptions that can be validated later.
## Instructions: The AI will prompt for what you know about the user (demographics, role, context) and then craft a persona profile including name, story, goals, needs, frustrations, etc. Use the output to align the team’s understanding of the user, but remember it’s hypothetical until confirmed by research.
## Attribution: Draws on UX persona creation techniques (Alan Cooper personas) simplified for hypothesis-driven development (proto-personas as per Lean UX).
