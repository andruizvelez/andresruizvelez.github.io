<!--
## Description: Develops a comprehensive user archetype by capturing detailed aspects like motivations, barriers, influences, and environment in a single canvas.
## Usage Note: Use when you want to deepen a persona or understand a user segment holistically. Input any relevant details about your user (context, attitudes, influences) and the prompt will fill out a canvas covering multiple angles of the user’s life and mindset.
## Instructions: The AI will ask questions about various facets of the user (background, motivations, frustrations, influences, etc.). Answer these to the best of your knowledge or assumptions. It will then produce a structured profile touching on each area to inform design and strategy decisions.
## Attribution: Combines elements from empathy mapping and persona canvases used in design thinking to create a multi-dimensional user profile.
