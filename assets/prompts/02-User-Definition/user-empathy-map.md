<!--
## Description: Structures what a user says, thinks, does, and feels about an experience, to help teams empathize with the user's perspective.
## Usage Note: Use when analyzing user research or brainstorming user feelings about a scenario. Provide context for the user and scenario; the prompt will generate insights in each of the four empathy map quadrants.
## Instructions: The AI will prompt for any known user quotes or thoughts, actions observed, and feelings. It will then compile a coherent empathy map. Use this to uncover inconsistencies (e.g., user says one thing but thinks another) and to drive user-centric decisions.
## Attribution: Adapted from the Empathy Map framework by Dave Gray (XPLANE), widely used in design thinking.

- [Another thought, concern, or question on their mind].

**Does:**
